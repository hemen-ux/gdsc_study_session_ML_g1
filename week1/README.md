# Python Revision and Machine Learning Basics Assignment

## Overview
This assignment consists of two parts:
1. A technical Python task using NumPy
2. A non-technical task explaining basic Machine Learning concepts

The work is implemented and documented using a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).

## Task 1: Python Revision (Technical)

### Objective
The goal of this task is to revise basic Python and NumPy operations by:
- Creating a list of numbers
- Converting it into a NumPy array
- Performing basic numerical calculations

### Steps Performed
1. Created a list containing five numeric values
2. Converted the list into a NumPy array
3. Calculated:
   - Mean (average)
   - Maximum value
   - Sum of the elements
4. Printed the results clearly

### Tools Used
- Python 3
- NumPy library
- Jupyter Notebook

## Task 2: Machine Learning Concepts (Non-Technical)

### Identified ML Problem
Predicting whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on study hours and attendance.

### Machine Learning Type
**Supervised Learning**

This is supervised learning because the model is trained using labeled data, where the output (pass or fail) is already known.

### Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Making predictions on new data

### Possible Failure Point
**Noisy Data**

Incorrect or inconsistent data can reduce model accuracy.  
This issue can be fixed by cleaning the dataset, removing errors, and handling missing values properly.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Open Jupyter Notebook
2. Load the provided `.ipynb` file
3. Run the code cells for technical
4. Read the Markdown cells for nontechnical
